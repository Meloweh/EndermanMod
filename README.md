# Minecraft Enderman Mod

Modification for the transformation of the player into another creature (Enderman Mod) (2011-2018):

Description:

The desire to make this modification was a childhood dream prior to my programming experience, which accompanied me for over 8 years in my programming career.
It was the driving force that set me on my career path and my first project.

The project requires the ability to learn unfamiliar project structures independently, a basic understanding of networking (C2S), capability systems, the understanding of how to cleanly integrate own code into a foreign project and much more.

After several approaches over the time my work was finally successful.
